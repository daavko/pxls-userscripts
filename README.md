# Pxls userscripts by daavko

## Installation

1. Get a userscript extension for your browser. Popular options include (this is not an exhaustive list):
    - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
    - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
    - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2. Install the script you want by visiting [pxls.daavko.moe](https://pxls.daavko.moe/) and clicking the link in the "Userscripts" section.
   This will automatically install the script in your userscript extension.

Note: The script should work on any userscript extension, but they it's primarily tested on Tampermonkey. If you
encounter any issues, please create an issue on this GitHub repository or find me on Discord.

## List of scripts

The available scripts can be enabled or disabled at the bottom of Pxls settings after you have installed the userscript.

### Template color autoselector

This script automatically selects the color of the pixel you are currently hovering over, based on the loaded template.
There's various options in the settings menu to customize the behavior of the script.

### Milestone watcher

This script checks the amount of pixels you have placed (on current canvas and overall), and notifies you when you reach
a milestone. You can customize the milestones in the settings menu.

### Grief tracker

This script highlights griefed pixels with a configurable highlight.

This should be pretty obvious, but... **this script makes use of flashing animations to highlight things, don't use it
if you have epilepsy or something similar**

### Template info

Shows basic template info in the info bubble.

### Available pixels flasher

Flashes the entire screen when you gain available pixels. Fully configurable so you can make it as obnoxious or as
subtle as you want.

### Pogpega utils

Utility features for the Pogpega bot, see script settings for details.

### Template Refresher

Automatically refreshes the template at a configurable interval.

- `--watch` - Watch for changes in the script and rebuild automatically
